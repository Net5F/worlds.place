    <p>Easily create virtual worlds that support up to 2,000 players.

      <p>If you enjoy virtual worlds (MMOs, etc), you likely have ideas for how to improve them. Unfortunately, there's no practical way for you to build your own virtual world to try out those ideas. Modern engines are great for singleplayer or match-based games, but fail to easily scale up to large player counts.
    </div>
    <div class="homeColumn">
      <p>Back in the 90s, we had popular MUD codebases that allowed anyone to get involved. However, as virtual worlds grew from text-based to graphical, the open source community failed to keep up. Now, virtual worlds are largely controlled by giant, risk-averse corporations.
    </div>
    <div class="homeColumn">
      <p>To revitalize virtual worlds, we need new tools that are available to everyone: that's why we're creating The Amalgam Engine. It isn't finished yet, but it's far enough along for you to check it out and get involved. See below and explore the tabs above for more info.

  <h2>Engine Details</h2>
  <ul class="homeUl">
    <li>Free, open source.
    <li>Supports 1,000 - 2,000 players spread throughout the world (depending on world complexity and hardware).
    <li>Or, supports 200+ players in the same area (great for social worlds and event spaces). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7eCfXj04cE">Video</a>
    <li>Runs on a single server. Optimized to perform well on inexpensive hardware.
    <li>Live, in-world build tools. Build alone, collaborate with others, or empower your players to change the world.
    <li>Isometric, sprite-based graphics. Allows both 2D and 3D artists to get involved.
    <li>3D world simulation. Makes it possible to jump, duck, and fly, depending on your gameplay needs.
    <li>Provides template worlds (such as Repose, pictured above), so you don't have to start from scratch.
    <li>Beginner-friendly C++ codebase. Thoughtfully architected to be clear and easy to learn.
    <li>Custom UI library, focused on the needs of virtual world developers. 
    <li>Supports Windows and Linux.
    <li>To come: sims-like build mode, text chat, NPCs, items, and user accounts. <a href="/roadmap.html">See the roadmap</a>
