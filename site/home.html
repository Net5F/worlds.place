    <p>Easily create virtual worlds that support up to 2,000 players per server.
    <p>Fully open source, community driven.
    <p>Focused on creativity, innovation, and fun.
  </div>

  <p>The Amalgam Engine is a C++/Lua-based engine for creating virtual worlds. Use it to prototype ideas, build small worlds for your friends, or even create full MMOs.

  <h2>Why use The Amalgam Engine?</h2>
  <ul class="homeUl">
  <li>Faster than any other engine at building virtual worlds
    <ul class="homeUl2">
      <li>Networking, physics, and many other necessary systems (e.g. items, inventory) are fully implemented out of the box
    </ul>
  <li>Higher player counts than any other engine
    <ul class="homeUl2">
      <li>1,000 - 2,000 players spread throughout the world (depending on world complexity and hardware)
      <li>Or, 200+ players in the same area (great for social worlds and event spaces)
    </ul>
  <li>Provides the tools needed to innovate
    <ul class="homeUl2">
      <li>Prototype your virtual world ideas as easily as prototyping a single-player game in other engines
      <li>Build content collaboratively with a live, in-world "build mode"
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h2>Get Involved</h2>
  <p>For too long, virtual worlds have been controlled by giant, risk-averse corporations. By building tools that allow small teams to create virtual worlds, we hope to start a new golden age of innovation in the genre.
  <p>Whether you're a developer, artist, or just a fan of virtual worlds, we encourage you to get involved by <a href="https://discord.gg/EA2Sg3ar74">joining the Discord.</a>
