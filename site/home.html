      <p>What would your dream virtual world look like? Maybe it's a relaxing social world, filled with lush gardens and good friends. Or maybe it's a world of chaos and war, where your wit and your grit are the only things keeping you from an early death. If you're particularly adventurous, maybe it's a sci-fi world where grid runners fold space and time to run heists against evil corporations.

    <div class="homeColumn">
      <p>Back in the 90s, regular people could take these ideas and make their own text-based worlds using freely-available engines. Unfortunately, as we moved to graphical worlds, technology progressed so quickly that only well-funded companies could keep up.
      <p>Fast-forward to today and we largely see virtual worlds controlled by giant, risk-averse corporations. Greed is rampant and creativity is scarce.

    <div class="homeColumn">
      <p>To revitalize virtual worlds, we need new tools that are available to everyone. That's why we're creating The Amalgam Engine: a free, open-source engine that makes it easy to create virtual worlds. The engine isn't finished yet, but it's far enough along for you to check it out and get involved. See below and explore the tabs above for more info.

  <h2>Engine Details</h2>
  <ul class="homeUl">
    <li>Free, open source.
    <li>Windows, Linux.
    <li>Isometric, sprite-based graphics. Allows both 2D and 3D artists to get involved.
    <li>3D world simulation. Makes it possible to jump, duck, and fly, depending on your gameplay needs.
    <li>Runs on a single server. Optimized to perform well on inexpensive hardware.
    <li>Supports 1,000 - 2,000 players spread throughout the world (depending on world complexity and hardware).
    <li>Or, supports 150+ players in the same area (great for social worlds and event spaces). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7eCfXj04cE">Video</a>
    <li>Provides template worlds (such as Repose, pictured above), so you don't have to start from scratch.
    <li>Live, in-world map editing. Build alone, collaborate with others, or empower your players to change the world.
    <li>Beginner-friendly C++ codebase. Thoughtfully architected to be clear and easy to learn.
    <li>Networking code is all included. Easy to add your own messages.
    <li>Custom UI library, focused on the needs of virtual world developers. 
    <li>To come: sims-like build mode, text chat, NPCs, items, and user accounts. <a href="/roadmap.html">See the roadmap</a>
