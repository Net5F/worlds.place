  <h1>Building And Running Locally On Windows</h1>

  <h2>1. Installing Visual Studio</h2>
  <p>Download <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio 2022 Community</a> and install it. Choose the "Visual C++" or "Desktop development with C++" option if prompted.
  <p><em>Be sure to download Visual Studio and not Visual Studio Code, a confusingly-named different program.</em>

  <h2>2. Downloading the project files</h2>
  <p>We're going to use Repose as our example project. Download <a href="https://github.com/Net5F/Repose/releases/latest/download/FullSourceCode.zip">the project's source code</a> and unzip it.
  <p>Or, if you're comfortable cloning a git repo, you can instead run:
  <pre><code>git clone --recursive git@github.com:Net5F/Repose.git</code></pre>

  <h2>3. Building the project</h2>
  <p>Open Visual Studio and select "Continue without code". Once in the editor, select "File" &rarr; "Open" &rarr; "CMake". In the file picker, navigate to the "Repose" folder that we unzipped and choose "CMakeLists.txt".
  <p>In the the top bar, look for a dropdown menu that says "x64-Debug" and change it to "x64-Release". It will start auto-configuring, wait for it to finish.
  <p>We're ready to build! Select "Build" &rarr; "Build All".

  <h2>4. Running the server and client</h2>
  <p>After the build step is complete, we can go look for our executables.
  <p>Open the Repose/Build/Windows/Release/Source folder and you should see Client and Server folders.
  <p>Open the Server folder and double-click Server.exe, then open the Client folder and double-click Client.exe. You now should be able to press the "Connect" button in the client to connect to your server.
  <p>Congratulations! You're now in full control of your own virtual world.
