  <h1>Building And Running Locally On Windows</h1>

  <h2>1. Installing Visual Studio</h2>
  <p>Download <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio 2022 Community</a> and install it. Choose the "Visual C++" or "Desktop development with C++" option if prompted.
  <p><em>Be sure to download Visual Studio and not Visual Studio Code, a confusingly-named different program.</em>

  <h2>2. Installing Git for Windows</h2>
  <em>If you already have a way to clone a git repo, you can skip this step.</em>
  <p>Download <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">Git for Windows</a> and install it. TODO: Do you need an account to clone?

  <h2>3. Cloning the project repo</h2>
  <p>Next, we're going to download the project's files.
  <p>Open File Explorer and navigate to where you want the project files to go.
  <p>Right click inside the folder and a "Git Bash Here" option should be available (added by Git for Windows). Click it to open a terminal, then enter the following:
  <pre><code>git clone git@github.com:Net5F/Repose.git --recurse-submodules</code></pre>
  <p>This will create a "Repose" folder and fill it with the project's source code.

  <h2>4. Building the project</h2>
  <p>Now, we're going to open the project and build it.
  <p>Open Visual Studio and select "Continue without code". Once in the editor, select "File" &rarr; "Open" &rarr; "CMake". In the file picker, choose "CMakeLists.txt" (in the Repose folder from the last step).
  <p>Let the auto-configure step run. In the middle of the top bar, look for a dropdown menu that says "x64-Debug" and change it to "x64-Release". Let it auto-configure again.
  <p>We're ready to build! Select "Build" &rarr; "Build All".

  <h2>5. Running the server and client</h2>
  <p>After the build step is complete, we can go look for our executables.
  <p>Open the Repose/Build/Windows/Release/Source folder and you should see Client and Server folders.
  <p>Open the Server folder and double-click Server.exe, then open the Client folder and double-click Client.exe. You now should be able to press the "Connect" button in the client to connect to your server.
  <p>Congratulations! You're now in full control of your own virtual world.
