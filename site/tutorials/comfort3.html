  <h1>Editing A Sprite</h1>

  <p>Even without running your own server, Amalgam Engine worlds let you do some local art modding. Other people won't be able to see your changes, but it's a good way to dip your toe into working on a world!

  <h2>1. Finding a sprite to edit</h2>
  <p>In the client folder that you downloaded previously, look for an Assets folder. Inside will be a Textures folder that contains all of the world's sprites.
  <p>Look through the sprite sheets and choose one to edit. Ideally, it would be one that you know how to find in-world.

  <h2>2. Editing the sprite</h2>
  <p>Make a backup of your chosen sprite sheet if you'd like (make a copy and name it something like "name"_old.png). Then, open your chosen sprite sheet in an image editor, such as Paint.NET or GIMP. Make some changes (recoloring is usually pretty easy) and save the file.

  <h2>3. Viewing your changes in-world</h2>
  <p>With the file saved, connect to the world and find an instance of your edited sprite. If all went well, you should see your changes in-world!
