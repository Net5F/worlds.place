  <h1>Trying Out An Existing World</h1>

  <p>Welcome! Before we dig into building our own world, let's spend some time with an existing world.

  <h2>1. Downloading a client</h2>
  <p>First, we need to pick a world. Head over to <a href="/worlds.html">the worlds page</a> and choose one that looks cool. Then, click the Download button to download its client.

  <h2>2. Running the client</h2>
  <p>Unzip the client and open the folder. Double-click the Client.exe (Windows) or Client (Linux) binary to launch it.
  <p>Depending on the world, you may need to create an account to log in. Do what you need to, then get in there and have some fun!
