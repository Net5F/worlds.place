  <h1>Changing User Configuration Settings</h1>

  <p>Next, we'll learn how to make some simple settings changes.

  <h2>1. Changing a setting</h2>
  <p>Look for a "UserConfig.json" file in the same directory as the Client binary. Open it and take a look at the available settings.
  <p>Depending on the project, there may be more or fewer settings available. Change any settings that you'd like to, save the file, and re-open the client to see your changes.
