  <h1>Hey</h1>

  <p>Hello future person, thanks for visiting my website and checking out the engine. I appreciate you taking the time.

  <p>I'm getting close now to finishing this site, I just have the home page left to style. That's pretty scary. I'll have to show this project to people for real soon. They'll look at what I've been working on for the past three years and judge it. I think a lot of people will consider the site design dated, or the engine unappealing. That's fine, I've accepted that I have to build things that I believe in&mdash;things that carry my personality. My choices won't be for everyone, but hopefully this will all resonate with some people.

  <p>I struggle with judging anything as worthwhile enough to be worth wasting another person's time. I just had that thought about this post, so I'll end it here.

  <p>I hope you have a nice day,
  <p>Net_
