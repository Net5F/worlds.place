  <h1>Hey</h1>

  <p>Hello future person, thanks for visiting my website and checking out the engine. I appreciate you taking the time.

  <p>I'm getting close now to finishing this site, I just have the home page left to style. I think a lot of people will consider the site design dated, or the engine unappealing. That's fine, I've accepted that I have to build things that I believe in&mdash;things that carry my personality. My choices won't be for everyone, but hopefully this will all resonate with some people.

  <p>I hope you have a nice day,
  <p>Net_
