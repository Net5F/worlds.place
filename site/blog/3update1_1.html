  <h2><u>Motivation</u></h2>
  <p>This update was focused around improving the build mode experience. I'm really happy with how it turned out, we now have a powerful "Sprite Set" abstraction that lets project devs group sprites into a higher-level context (Floors, Floor Coverings, Walls, and Objects). With that context, the engine is now able to automatically provide a ton of functionality that the project dev would otherwise have to implement themselves. 
  <p>These build mode improvements set us up perfectly for the next feature: Imagine using build mode to place an object, writing its onUse behavior in a lua script, then updating it live. This will soon be possible, with Dynamic Objects!

  <h2><u>Release Notes</u></h2>
  <h3>New Sprite Editor Workflow</h3>
  <p>To import your art for use in The Amalgam Engine:
  <ol>
    <li>Open the Sprite Editor and import your sprite sheet.
    <li>Draw bounding boxes on your sprites.
    <li>Add your sprites to a sprite set.
  </ol>

  <h3>Improved Build Mode</h3>
  <p>Build mode has new and improved tools:
  <ol>
    <li>An easy to use "Remove" tool.
    <li>A context-aware "Wall" tool.
    <li>Simple tools for Floors, Floor Coverings, and Objects.
  </ol>

  <h3>Behind-the-scenes Improvements</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>(AUI) Refactored the Image widget to be really easy to use.
    <li>(AUI) Added nine slice support to Image widget.
    <li>(AUI) Big refactor to support widget clipping.
    <li>(AUI) Added smooth-scrolling list widget.
    <li>(AUI) Added collapsible container widget.
    <li>Refactored SpriteDataBase and SpriteData to support sprite sets.
    <li>Updated SpriteData.json format to support sprite sets.
    <li>Refactored TileMapBase and TileMap to support sprite sets.
    <li>Improved TileMapBase's interface, taking advantage of sprite sets (it's now really nice to use).
    <li>Refactored tile map update messages to be closer to TileMapBase's interface.
    <li>Added Ray concept and Ray/BoundingBox intersection.
    <li>Added WorldObjectLocator, which lets the UI cast a ray from the mouse and get the intersected world objects (tile layers, entities).
  </ol>

  <p>These changes are now live in The World of Repose. Feel free to walk to the build area and play around with them.
